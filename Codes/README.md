## Overview 
This folder has all R codes to perform the analysis in "paper_title". All data analyses were performed in R version 3.5.0 in linux OS (high-spec machine for computation), while a few post-hoc visualization (such as making plots based on the predicted values) were executed in R version 4.1.2 in windows OS for convinience.

#### 0.1-MyFun_BoxcoxFunction.R
This is an R code to apply Box-Cox transformation, including an optimization of the convinient lambda value. This function was used in Wu et al. (in prep) for the tocochromanol phenotypes in Ames panel, and therfore we applied the same method to the phenotypes in the 282 panel.

#### 0.2-MultiKernel_MyFunToSelectSnps.R
